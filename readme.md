## Getting Started

To get started with Viva, you will need the following:

### Requirements
- Requires .NET Sdk 9.0 or higher installed on your machine.
- You will also need to install the required NuGet packages.
	```powershell
	dotnet add package Viva
	dotnet add package Viva.Runtime
	dotnet add package Viva.Playwright
	```

## Features

- **Efficient data extraction**: Viva offers tools for extracting data from various sources.
- **Flexible transformation capabilities**: Offers tools for cleaning, manipulating, and enhancing extracted data.
- **Apply transformations**: Includes features like filtering, aggregating, joining data, etc.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Usage
- Add the packages to your project
	```powershell
	dotnet add package Viva
	dotnet add package Viva.Runtime
	dotnet add package Viva.Playwright
	```
- Simplified example.
	1. Setup Logging.
		```fsharp
		open Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
		open Microsoft.Playwright

		open FsToolkit.ErrorHandling
		open Viva.Runtime.Helpers.Operator.Result
		open Viva.Playwright

		let factory =
			LoggerFactory.Create(fun builder ->
				builder
					.AddSimpleConsole(fun options ->
						options.SingleLine <- true
						options.IncludeScopes <- true
						options.TimestampFormat <- "hh:mm:ss tt - "
					)
					.SetMinimumLevel
		#if DEBUG
					LogLevel.Debug
		#else
					LogLevel.Information
		#endif

				|> ignore
			)
		```
	2. Use Playwright to interact with a website.
		```fsharp
		MsEdge.Create(factory, BrowserTypeLaunchOptions(Headless = false), BrowserNewContextOptions(ViewportSize = ViewportSize.NoViewport))
		>>= _.Open("https://www.youtube.com/")
		<!> _.SetDefaultTimeOut(TimeSpan.FromMinutes 30L)
		<!> _.GetByRole(AriaRole.Combobox, "Search")
		>>= _.Fill("linux brtfs")
		>>= _.Press("ArrowDown")
		>>= _.PressAndClose("Enter")
		<!> _.GetByLabel("Search filters")
		>>= _.ClickAndClose()
		<!> _.GetBySelector("ytd-search-filter-renderer", "This year")
		>>= _.ClickAndClose()
		<!> _.GetByRole(AriaRole.Link, "This year")
		>>= _.ClickAndClose()
		|> Result.tee(fun _ -> Async.Sleep 5000 |> Async.RunSynchronously)
		```
	3. Close the page and Playwright context, and finally dispose of the factory
		```fsharp
		>>= _.CloseAll()
		|> ignore

		factory.Dispose()
		```
## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Viva project! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Set up development environment.
	1. Install .Net Sdk
	2. Docker (if Linux distro is not supported by Playwright)
		- Docker is used for testing Playwright code. Podman isn't recommended due to lack of BuildKit support.
		- The [container image](lscr.io/linuxserver/msedge:latest) includes browser-based KASMVnc for GUI development.
	3. VS Code
		- Dev Container Extension
			- Automatically installs .NET (dotnet).
			- Sets up necessary tools and restores packages needed for your project.
			- Configures required extensions.

		*Note:* This setup has not been tested with other IDEs like Visual Studio or Rider.
2. Fork the Viva repository.
3. Clone your forked repository to a local machine.
4. Create a new branch for your changes.
5. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages.
6. Submit a pull request, providing a clear description of your changes.
7. We will review your pull request and provide feedback or merge your changes.
