    PlaywrightContext.createPlaywrightContext(
        MsEdge,
        BrowserTypeLaunchOptions(Headless = false),
        BrowserNewContextOptions(ViewportSize = ViewportSize.NoViewport),
        factory
    )
```

## Contributing
Here's a guide to setting up your development environment:

### Docker
- Docker is used for testing Playwright code. Podman isn't recommended due to lack of BuildKit support.
- The [container image](lscr.io/linuxserver/msedge:latest) includes browser-based KASMVnc for GUI development.

### VS Code
#### Dev Container Extension:

- Automatically installs .NET (dotnet).
- Sets up necessary tools and restores packages needed for your project.
- Configures required extensions.
*Note:* This setup has not been tested with other IDEs like Visual Studio or Rider.
